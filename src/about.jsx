                    <p className="mt-4 font-lato font-bold text-black-600 text-lg">"Hi, I am Nahian Fariha, the founder and sole artist of Dot Pictures Studio. I started Dot Picture Studio during my final year at university, around the time of the COVID-19 lockdown. What began as a creative outlet during quarantine grew into a three-year journey from May 2021 to April 2024. During this time, I created and sold paintings, graphic designs, print materials, and hand-painted tote bags. I also provided customized art and design services tailored to individual needs.</p>

<p className="mt-4 font-lato font-bold text-black-600 text-lg"> Alongside my artistic work, I practiced coding, explored web development and user experience design, and studied machine learning. Gradually, my interest in machine learning grew stronger, leading me to focus on it professionally. </p>

<p className="mt-4 font-lato font-bold text-black-600 text-lg"> Dot Picture Studio remains a meaningful hobbyâ€”an outlet for creativity alongside my evolving academic and career ambitions."</p>
